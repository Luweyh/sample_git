Luwey's Assignment 1 README

How to Compile:
gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies movies.c
./movies movies_sample_1.csv

You can also do: (this is shortcut but use option above to create a movie file)
gcc movies.c
./a.out movies_sample_1.csv

The program should work and it meets all requirements on rubrick!
The data file should look like the provided one in canvas (movies_sample_1.csv)

I had to copy and paste my code from OS1 so please let me know if it doesnt work
due to how I copy and paste the information.

The assignment overall should match very very simliar to output provided in canvas.
